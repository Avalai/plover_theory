Started with the letters

I'd like to move on to the sounds present on each side not present on the other side.

The other way to go about it is two letter combinations, three letter combinations, but I'm not totally convinced that that is any less arbitrary.

So first: final K, W \(au, ou\), h \(sh, ch, th\).

Then beginning F, B, L, G, D, Z.

Then letters on both sides \(M, N, J, V, X\)

Then letters on the left side \(Q, Y\)
