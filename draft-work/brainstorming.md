Brainstorming/draft work

Started with the letters

I'd like to move on to the sounds present on each side not present on the other side.

The other way to go about it is two letter combinations, three letter combinations, but I'm not totally convinced that that is any less arbitrary.

So first: final K, W \(au, ou\), h \(sh, ch, th\). Ending -shun

Then beginning F, B, L, G, D, Z.

Then letters on both sides \(M, N, J, V, X\)

Then letters on the left side \(Q, Y\)

Advanced endings: rve, nch

From the top 100, this is left:

In, have, I, for, not, on, do, but, by, from, an, will, my, one, there their they're, if, about, get, which, go, me, when, make, like, time, no, just, know, take, people, into, year, your, good, some, them, see, other, than, then, now, look, only, come, its, over, think, also, back, use, two, first, way, even, new, want, because, any, these, give, day, most

Important prefixes: words beginning with con/com, on, pre, re, int

Important

Advanced number usage, such as -Z, -D, clock times, Roman numerals?

Brief families:

* Months of the year
* Units inch, feet, kilometers, kilograms etc.
* Phrases

I want to get Jeff to make illustrations, mainly to draw the exercise sentences. I want a wet rat to be hugged.

In the later lessons I think I'll move more into a format where I have one or two "letters" as opposed to just the drilling sentences.
