# Lesson 4:  \*, D, and Z

The last couple keys on the main part of the board are off the main layout and will require some lateral \(side-to-side\) movement from your fingers to reach them. It's best not to shift your whole hand, as you don't want all your fingers to get out of place.

The keys used in this lesson include those used in previous lessons, plus:

* `* - *   DZ`
* `4 - 4   11`

The numbers show the fingers for each key, where 1's are the pinkies and 5 are the thumbs.

Your keyboard may have multiple asterisks, up to four, or just one. As long as you can hit the asterisks with either index finger, you should be fine. The asterisk can be hit alone, or in conjunction with its neighboring keys. That is why often the gap between the asterisk key and `-FR` tends to be smaller than the gaps between other columns.

Most stenographers hit the asterisk key exclusively with their right-hand, but you can feel free to only use your left-hand, or use them interchangeably. The left-hand tends to do less in steno \(responsible for only 9 keys instead of the right's typical 13\) so you might consider learning to use a left-side asterisk.

As for the `D` and `Z` keys, they are hit are the right pinky. They can be used alone, or in combos such as `TD`, `SZ`, or `DZ`. Note that, because the pinky is only one finger, you cannot hit `SD` or `TZ` because they are diagonal from each other. Some theories have you move your hand over and use your ring finger \(called a "Philly shift"\) but Plover doesn't use this trick. The pinky can, in rare cases, hit the entire `TSDZ` bank, but it is extremely rare in Plover Theory.

### Briefs

Now that we most of the keyboard available, there are many possible briefs to form. The briefs chosen here are used in the lesson and extend what you learned in lesson 2.

| Chord | Translation | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
|  | are | Either side works. |
| SKP- | and | This stroke is arbitrary, remember it by hand shape. |
| AEU | a | This is the word "a |
| K- | can |  |
| W- | with | Many people use "w" as an abbreviation for "with". |
| -B | be | The letter "B" is a homophone to "be" |
| KW-BG | {,} | Comma. |

_\*Notice that _`{}`_ are used to denote a special character in Plover's translation format._

### How to Practice

It might be valuable for you to write down or print briefs that you have trouble remembering. Some stenographers find it helpful to say the raw in their head as a mnemonic. For example, you might see `SKP` for "and", and think "skuhpah" as you stroke it to help remember the keys.

Others like to imagine the shapes of the chords, thinking of `SKP` as a ramp heading up on the left-hand side of the keyboard.

Finally, often building muscle memory is crucial for writing fast. Try drilling the brief in the middle of a sentence, get used to moving your hands in and out of that brief's shape. `SKP/HA/SKP/PAP/SKP/SAT/SKP/HAT`.

### Lesson 3 Practice

Do your best to not refer to the charts all the time. Eventually you will need to go without them. Sometimes you can figure out the meaning of an outline based on the context of a sentence.

The skill of recognizing words based on context is helpful for advanced stenographers who may need to dissect a word that they wrote incorrectly and find what they meant.

#### 3.1 Translate

Write the English sentence represented by these outlines, including punctuation.

1. `-T KAT SKP -T PUG R UP TP-PL`
2. `ROL TO -T TOP TP-PL`
3. `RUB -T SOFT PUG SKP -T KAT TP-PL`
4. `WE H TO STOP -T KAR AT -T KURB TP-PL`
5. `AEU KRAB K KUT US H-F`
6. `U K -B AEU STAR TP-PL`
7. `W AEU TOP HAT U K -B HOT TP-PL`
8. `HUF KW-BG PUF KW-BG SKP STOP TP-PL`
9. `T S AEU KUT -F -T RUG TP-PL`

If you ever can't read an outline, you can try writing it into your steno machine with Plover running to see what it translates to.

#### 3.2 Find Outlines

Find steno outlines that will write these English sentences, including punctuation.

1. Huff, puff, and start.
2. Cut up the rug.
3. Hug a wet rat.
4. Tug at the straps.
5. You had a skull.
6. You are a star of sorts.
7. Is it a worse cut?
