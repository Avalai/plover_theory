# Lesson 1: Chorded Keyboard

Stenography uses a chorded keyboard. **On a chorded keyboard, you hit multiple keys at once**, instead of one at a time. All keys are released simultaneously and the **order that you hit them in doesn't matter**.

### Steno Order

Steno keys are always processed in the same order. No matter if you hit "HU" or "UH" on the keyboard in either order, the chord is always processed as "HU".

**The full steno order is:**

> **\#STKPWHRAO\*EUFRPBLGTSDZ**

The** left-hand side gives us the starting sounds** \(onset\), the **center gives us the vowel sounds**, and the **right-hand side gives us the ending sounds** \(coda\).

Most stenographers will memorize steno order, either in study or as a consequence of reading raw steno notes.

### Home Row

Unlike a keyboard, stenography's entire layout is almost fully covered by just its home row. **The home position for stenography is between the cracks for each set of keys.**

The only keys not covered in the home row are `*`, `-D`, and `-Z`. To hit these, your fingers will need to shift to the side during writing. Otherwise, **your** **hand position never changes **which makes for great ergonomics.

#### Finger Position

Each finger is responsible for just two keys, except:

* The left pinky which only has one: `S`
* The right index which has three: `*`, `-F`, `-R`
* The right pinky which has four: `-T`, `-S`, `-D`, `-Z`

Of note, some users use the left index finger to hit `*`. It is a matter of personal preference. It is okay to use either or both hands.

#### Backspacing

Instead of backspacing letter-by-letter, stenography backspaces one chord at a time. To "undo" the last stroke, simply press the `*` key \(the asterisk key\).

### Lesson 1 Practice

#### 1.1 Pattern Recognition

For each raw steno chord, identify whether or not it is in steno order.

1. `SKTA`
2. `SPA`
3. `TSUN`
4. `PAP`
5. `AH`
6. `TKPBAODZ`
7. `KAT`
8. `TAC`
9. `ZAOPL`
10. `SOS`
11. `HROF`

Remember, steno order is firm and is never broken. Without a consistent order stenography would be much more ambiguous and confusing.
