# Lesson 1: Chorded Keyboard

Stenography uses a chorded keyboard. On a chorded keyboard, you hit multiple keys at once, instead of one at a time. All keys are released simultaneously and the order that you hit them in doesn't matter.

### Steno Order

Steno keys are always processed in the same order. No matter if you hit "HU" or "UH" on the keyboard in either order, the chord is always processed as "HU".

The full steno order is:

> \#STKPWHRAO\*EUFRPBLGTSDZ

The left-hand side gives us the starting sounds \(onset\), the center, controlled by the thumbs, gives us the vowel sounds, and the right-hand side gives us the ending sounds \(coda\).

Most stenographers will memorize steno order, either in study or as a consequence of reading raw steno notes.

### Home Row

Unlike a keyboard, stenography is almost fully covered by just its home row. And, instead of having the home row on a set of keys, the home row for stenography is between the cracks for each set of keys.

The only keys not covered in the home row are `*`, `-D`, and `-Z`. To hit these, your fingers will need to shift to the side during writing. Otherwise, your hand position never changes which makes stenography quite ergonomic.

#### Finger Position

Each finger is responsible for just two keys, except:

* The left pinky which only has one: `S`
* The right index which has three: `*`, `-F`, `-R`
* The right pinky which has four: `-T`, `-S`, `-D`, `-Z`

### Lesson 1 Practice

For each raw steno chord, identify whether or not it is in steno order.

* `SKTA`
* `SPA`
* `DOG`
* `PAP`
* `AH`
* `TKPBAODZ`
* `KAT`
* `TAK`
