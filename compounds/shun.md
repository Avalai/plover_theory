# -shun, -kshun

_Special thanks to Thomas Pacheco for funding this lesson._

This lesson covers how to write words that end in "shun" like "ration" and "action".

-------

To end a word with the "shun" sound we use the chord `-GS` on the right hand.

{% stenodisplay labels="all" %}
-GS
{% endstenodisplay %}

* `TPAGS`: fashion
* `RAGS`: ration
* `PAGS`: passion
* `OEGS`: ocean
* `PHAPBGS`: mansion

Note that the `-GS` chord may conflict with words ending with "gs" suck as "rags". Most of the time, you can just resolve this by using `-GZ`:

* `RAGS`: ration
  - `RAGZ`: rags

However, sometimes the "-shun" word gets an asterisk as it is less common than "-gs" word:

* `RUGS`: rugs
  - `R*UGS`: Russian

Unfortunately, there's no hard and fast rule on when a word does and doesn't get the asterisk. You'll have to memorize the few exceptions over time.

### Kshun

Because `-GS` uses the `-G` in right-side K (`-BG`), we merge the chords to make "-kshun".

{% stenodisplay labels="all" %}
-BGS
{% endstenodisplay %}

- `RAOEBGS`: reaction
- `SEBGS`: section

Note that this conflicts with right-side X, which is the exact same chord. Usually, the theory will prefer right-side X, and add an asterisk to give you the kshun ending.

- `TPABGS`: fax
  - `TPA*BGS`: faction
- `ABGS`: axe
  - `A*BGS`: action
