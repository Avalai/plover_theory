# Lesson 2:  Top Row

This lesson introduces about **half the keyboard**: the** top row** of the keyboard and **two vowels**.

The keys used in this lesson are:

* `STPH A U FPLT`
* `1234 5 5 4321`

The numbers show the fingers for each key, where 1's are the pinkies and 5 are the thumbs.

### Chord Syntax

To denote a chord, note that any of these keys **can appear once**. If center keys are not present, we **add a hyphen to clarify which side the key is on**. Lack of a hyphen means the left side.

`T` or `T-` is the left-hand T.

`-T` is the right-hand T.

Even when there is no uncertainty, we still denote right-hand keys with a hyphen in front of them unless there's a vowel: `-F` or `AF`, but not `F`. Some conventions always include the hyphen, e.g. `A-F`, but this is not Plover style.

### Briefs

**Briefs are shortcuts** in stenography, and an essential component in gaining speed. While steno's base theory is syllabic, you will learn and use many briefs to get out **long words and phrases very quickly**.

The more common a word, the more likely it has a brief. In fact, the first bit of steno theory you are about to learn is about briefs that you can make with just `STPHAUFPLT`.

| Chord | Translation | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| S- | is |  |
| T- | it |  |
| H- | had |  |
| U | you | The letter "U" is a homophone to "you" |
| -T | the |  |
| TP-PL | {.} | Period. Next word is capitalized |
| H-F | {?} | Question mark. Next word is capitalized. |
| STPH-FPLT | {:} | Colon. It is the whole top row. |

_\*Notice that _`{}`_ are used to denote a special character in Plover's translation format._

### How to Practice

Now that you know some keys, some briefs, and the key orders, you should be able to start reading raw machine shorthand.

For example:

> -T PUP SAT TP-PL

Will translate to:

> The pup sat.

It's recommended to read through the raw steno, and whenever you encounter a new word, try sounding it out if you're unsure. If you can't figure out an outline, refer back to your brief tables to see if it's explained there. Remember, steno is phonetic so you will find words that are simple in steno but complicated in English spelling. Don't worry, that's an asset, not a problem!

This book does not require you to use your steno machine, but smart students will try writing down all the exercises on their own machine to build muscle memory and reenforce their learning.

### Lesson 2 Practice

Remember, `T-` and `T` are "it" while `-T` is "the". The hyphen denotes the center of the board.

#### 2.1 Translate

Write the English sentence represented by these outlines, including punctuation.

a. `-T HUL S TUF TP-PL`

b. `TAP -T SAP TP-PL`

c. `PUL -T HUL TP-PL`

d. `-T PAL H H T TP-PL`

e. `S -T PUP TUF H-F`

f. `U STPH-FPLT PUL -T TUF PUP TP-PL`

g. `-T HUT H HAF -T SALT TP-PL`

e. `U H STAF H-F`

_Notice how some examples contains two consonants after each other. Just like in spelling, this is used in steno._
