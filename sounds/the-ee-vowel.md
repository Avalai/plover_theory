# The EE Vowel

_Special thanks to a Paolo Michela for funding this lesson._

This lesson covers how you write the vowel sounds in "eel" and "real".

### Vowel Sound EE

The "ee" vowel is made with the outline `AOE`.

{% stenodisplay labels="all" %}
AOE
{% endstenodisplay %}

* `AOEL`: eel
* `HAOEL`: heel
* `PAOEL`: peel
* `STAOEL`: steel
* `TPAOEL`: feel
* `SAOE`: see
* `SAOEG`: seeing

### Words Spelled with "ea"

There are a lot of homophones that have "ea" instead of "ee"; like "meet" and "meat", "steel" and "steal", and "reel" and "real". To write the "ea" word, use `AE` instead of `AOE`.

`AE` can be used to resolve homophones in other vowels, too, like the difference between "bear" and "bare"
{% stenodisplay labels="all" %}
AE
{% endstenodisplay %}

* `HAOEL`: heel
  - `HAEL`: heal
* `PHAOET`: meet
  - `PHAET`: meat
* `RAOEL`: reel
  - `RAEL`: real
* `STAOEL`: steel
  - `STAEL`: steal

`AE` can be used to resolve homophones in other vowels, too, like the difference between "bear" and "bare":

- `PWAEUR`: bare
  - `PWAER`: bear
- `HAEUR`: hair
  - `HAER`: hear (word spelled with "ea")
  - `HA*EUR`: heir (asterisk given to less common alternative)
  - `HA*ER`: hare (asterisk given to less common alternative)
