# The Letter M

This lesson covers how you write the initial and final M on the steno layout.

### Initial M

Initial M is made with the combination `PH` on the left side.

* `PHA`: ma
* `PHAD`: mad
* `PHUD`: mud
* `PHEUL`: mill
* `PHAUL`: maul
* `PHELT`: melt
* `PHUL`: mull

### Final M

Final M is made with the combination `-PL`. This _does_ conflict with words ending in "ple" like "apple" versus "am". However, the final M is much more common in English so in steno `-PL` defaults to final M.

* `APL`: am
* `PHOPL`: mom
* `PHUPL`: mum
* `TOPL`: Tom
* `PHRUPL`:plum
* `STORPL`: storm
* `PHAPL`: ma'am
* `TEPLT`: tempt
