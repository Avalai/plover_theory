# Final CH, TH

### Final CH

Words ending with the "tch" or "ch" sound are made on the right hand with `-FP`. It's also used if there is a homophone where the only differentiator is spelling.

* `WAFP`: watch
* `SWAFP`: swatch
* `HAFP`: hatch
* `KAFP`: catch

### Final TH

The first use of the asterisk for us is with final "th". Adding an asterisk to a chord with a `-T` in it will make a "th" sound. `*T` is the "th" sound.

* `WRA*T`: wrath
* `PA*T`: path
* `HA*T`: hath
* `WO*RT`: worth

### How to Practice

Now that we are beginning to use chorded sounds, reading shorthand will become more and more difficult. Don't worry too much if you feel like the difficulty of the practice material is going up, because it is! Luckily, professional stenographers rarely have to read their own raw steno notes. Instead, all translation is instant. You will usually be working from the word to the outlines, not from the outlines to the word.

Take note of all the possible ways that you could interpret a stroke if it's unclear initially.

### Practice

#### 1. Translate

Write the English sentence represented by these outlines, including punctuation.

1. `WO U TAUBG TO US H-F`
2. `WE KO START KW-BG SHO WE H-F`
3. `AULS HUG -T RATS TP-PH`
4. `HOU S -T KAT H-F`
5. `-T WORBG S EZ SKP HE S AULZ UP TO T TP-PH`
6. `T S OBG KW-BG WE R OBG AF AUL TP-PL`
7. `POR HER AEU KUP -F WAUR TP-PL`
8. `HE HAZ -T POUR -F HART TP-PL`
9. `SHE SAU HER AT -T WAUR AF AEU WAUBG TP-PL`

Remember that if you can't figure out an outline, you can look it up in the theory dictionary.
