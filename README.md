# Plover Theory: Learn Stenography

Stenography is the fastest way to input text. Court reports have used machine stenography since the early 1900s to take down spoken word in realtime.

Nowadays, stenography is used in live TV captioning, realtime transcription of conferences and lectures for the hard of hearing, and thanks to Plover, as a fun hobby.

The purpose of this book is to teach you Plover's steno theory. There are many different theories you can use and learn, but Plover comes with a perfectly competent dictionary for free that evolves over time.

What is Plover Theory? If you know about other steno theories, it is most comparable to StenEd but with more briefs and spelling disambiguators. Other popular theories include Magnum, Phoenix, and StarTran. Feel free to learn those instead, but know that the dictionaries cost money as do the lessons, whereas Plover theory comes from the hearts of volunteers who just want steno in the hands of everyone.
